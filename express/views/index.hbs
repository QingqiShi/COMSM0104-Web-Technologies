        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a zero-player game, meaning that given an initial state the game evolves automatically requiring no further input. The Game of Life demonstrates a simple initial state can evolve into a world with unexpected complexity just by complying with a few rules.</p>

        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>The Game of Life was invented by the Cambridge mathematician John Conway. This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an <a href="http://ddi.cs.uni-potsdam.de/HyFISCH/Produzieren/lis_projekt/proj_gamelife/ConwayScientificAmerican.htm"  target="_blank">article</a> published by Scientific American in 1970.</p>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
            <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
        </ol>
